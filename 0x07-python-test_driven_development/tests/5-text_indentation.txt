The ``text indent module``

First import the func

    >>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation

Now use it:    
    
    >>> text_indentation("This is a simple example. It has multiple sentences")
    This is a simple example.
    <BLANKLINE>
    It has multiple sentences
    >>> text_indentation("Another example: what do you think?")
    Another example:
    <BLANKLINE>
    what do you think?
    <BLANKLINE>
